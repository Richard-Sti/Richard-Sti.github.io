Hey there! I'm Richard, a Physics master's student at [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit채t M체nchen](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/), [Faculty of Physics](http://www.en.physik.lmu.de). My research interest lies in the interface between fundamental physics and machine learning in the fields of gravitational-wave cosmology and galaxy formation. On the theory side, I am interested in theories of gravity and, on the computational side, in applying novel machine learning methods to existing Bayesian inference tools.


Research
======
So far, I have worked on Bayesian inference in gravitational-wave astronomy, empirical modelling of the relation between galaxies and their halos (subhalo abundance matching) and co-developed a (reversible) Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. Currently, I mostly spend my time applying machine learning methods to the galaxy--halo connection in hydrodynamical simulations. In my master's thesis, I plan to investigate the lensing of gravitational-wave events that will regularly be detected by future detectors.


Background
======
I received my undergraduate education in Physics and Astrophysics at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk), from which I graduated (remotely) amid the COVID-19 pandemic in June 2020. Along the way, I spent my 2nd year on exchange at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), an experience that, among others, cemented my resolve to become a researcher. Thus, over the next years, I pursued several research projects (in Glasgow, Oxford, and Hannover) to make an educated decision about my future. Today, I am pursuing a master's degree in Physics at [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit채t M체nchen](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/), where I intend to gain a deeper insight into the inner workings of Nature before starting my Ph.D. studies.
