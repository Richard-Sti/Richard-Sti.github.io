Hi! I'm Richard, a Physics master's student at [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit채t M체nchen](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/),
[Faculty of Physics](http://www.en.physik.lmu.de). My research interest lies in the interface between fundamental physics
and machine learning in the fields of gravitational-wave cosmology and galaxy formation. On the theory side, I am interested
in theories of gravity and, on the computational side, in applying novel machine learning methods to existing Bayesian inference tools.

Background
======
I received my undergraduate education in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Glasgow,
from which I graduated (remotely) amid the COVID-19 pandemic in June 2020. Along the way,
I spent my 2nd year on exchange at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,
an experience that, among others, cemented my resolve to become a researcher. Thus, over
the next years, I pursued several research projects (in Glasgow, Oxford, and Hannover)
to make an educated decision about my future. Today, I am pursuing a master's degree in
Physics at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit채t M체nchen, where I intend to gain a deeper insight
into the inner workings of Nature before starting my Ph.D. studies.
