Education
======
* **Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München** (2020 - present)
    * MSc in Physics, with a research thesis in Astrophysics
* **University of Glasgow** (2016-2020)
    * BSc in Physics with Astrophysics with Honours of the First Class, GPA 21.3/22
* **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology** (2017-2018)
    * 2nd year undergraduate exchange

Work experience
======
* **Research Intern**: Albert Einstein Institute Hannover (summer 2020)
    * Project: *EPSIE: an Embarrassingly Parallel Sampler for Inference Estimation*
    * Added support for several Euclidean and non-Euclidean proposal in EPSIE (a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler), a reversible-jump MCMC support, and flexible jump interval durations
    * Supervised by Dr Collin Capano
    * (*to be submitted to MNRAS in March 2021*)
* **Research Intern**: University of Oxford (summer 2019)
    * Project: *The dependence of subhalo abundance matching on galaxy photometry and selection criteria*
    * Tested fundamental assumptions of clustering-fitted parametrised subhalo abundance matching modelling in both optically and HI-selected surveys, showed that the scatter in the galaxy--halo connection substantially increases in the faint galaxies and extended the domain of validity of the model
    * Supervised by Dr Harry Desmond
    * *(to be submitted to MNRAS in January 2021)*
* **Research Intern**: University of Glasgow (summer 2018)
    * Project: *Are stellar--mass binary black hole mergers isotropically distributed?*
    * Created a Bayesian model quantifying isotropy of the underlying angular distribution of the detected stellar-mass binary black hole mergers
    * Supervised by Dr John Veitch and Dr Chris Messenger
* **Data Analysis Intern**: Amper Market a.s., Prague, Czech Republic (summer 2017)
    * Examined imbalances in the electricity network to predict its future behaviour and studied the effects of cross-border electricity flow on the market prices
* **Refrigeration Operator** : Silver Bay Seafoods, Naknek, Alaska, USA (summer 2016)
